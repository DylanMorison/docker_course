  # the number of pods this deployment will create

  # this works similarly to the selector in our service config file.
  # When a deployment creates a pod it does not directly maintain it. Instead it
  # reaches out to the k8s api on master to actually create pods. Once a pod is created
  # the deployment gets a handle on the created pod using the following selector:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: web
  # configuration that will be used by every pod in this deployment

    metadata:
      # each pod will have a label of component: web
      labels:
        component: web
    spec:
      # each pod will contain a container with the following configuration:
      containers:
        - name: client
          image: stephengrider/multi-client
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9999
